    <article><p>After taking the class JOUR 2106, I am able to make my personal blog without using template, but pictures, videos and other elements I created myself. The blog is made of 10 HTML pages. I named them “Index page”, “About me page”, “Homework 1”, “Homework 3”, “Homework 4”, “Homework 5”, “Architecture”, “Art”, “Market”, and “Paper Offering” in Google Analytics Tool. </p>
    <p>“Index Page” is the main page of the blog and it links the all the other pages together. “About me page” is a brief introduction of myself and the blog. The four Homework pages are the products I made during class. It marks different stages of me throughout the class, from being able to make simple html layout to interactive charts. The remaining pages, including “Architecture”, “Art”, “Market” and “Paper Offering” are added to enrich the blog with my own journalistic work. </p>
    <p>Since there are too many pages, in the first part, we would investigate which pages contribute most to the total click rate and which is the most representative one. We would later analyze it separately. The contribution of different pages to the total click rate are shown in the below pie chart.</p>
      <center> <div id="main" style="width: 1100px;height:400px;"></div> </center>
      <p>The above graph show that the "Index page", with 51.36% of click rate, contributes most to the total click rate. It is followed by "About me Page" that takes up 20.46% of the total click rate. The remaining pages contribute 1-5% each. It shows that the “Index page” and “About me page” has the highest click rate among all the pages in the blog. 
</p>
<p>It could be explained that all of the promotion are done on the “index page”, therefore, almost all visitors will go to the “Index page” first before going to other pages. It explains the extreme difference between "Index page" and other pages. For "About me Page", it is placed on the top of in the cover photo of “Index page”. And it may be the reason why visitors click it most. Since it is the first button they will see after entering the blog.</p>
      <p>We would then analyze the click rate variation along the whole month. Since the pages other than "Index page" and "About me Page" contribute little to the total click rate, only "Total Click Rate", "Index Page" and "About me" are shown in the below line chart.</p>

                <div id="main2" style="width: 1100px;height:500px;"></div>
<p>The above chart shows the click rate history in April. We could see that, there are some sharp increases of visitor on 8th, 13th and 19th April. It is believed that they are caused by my own when editing the "Index Page". On 26th April and 30th April, the chart show a significant surge. It is probably caused by social media promotion of the blog.</p>

                   <p>There are 3 stages of promotion. The first stage is "Facebook Promotion", the second stage is "Instagram Post Promotion" and the final stage is "Instagram Story Promotion". Three Promotions have different effect on the total click rate.
</p>
                   <p>The "Facebook Promotion" is made on 25th April night. A public post with the link of "Index Page" are posted on the my Facebook. The comments and likes received is believed to be a further promoter, as friends of whom “liked” the post will see the post as well. Until now, the post got 71 likes, 33 comments, and 1 share in total.</p>
                  
                   <p>The "Instagram Post Promotion" is done on 27th April night. A private post with photo are posted on my Instagram. This post did not contain a link to the "Index page" as Instagram doesn’t support hyperlink function. Therefore, the promotion effect is expected to be weaker comparing with the "Facebook Promotion".
</p>
                   
                   <p>The "Instagram Story Promotion" is done on 29th April night. I posted a private temporary story in Instagram, and it links to the profile of me that includes a direct link to the blog "Index Page". It is expected to be more effective than the "Instagram Post" since the link is provided in this promotion.</p>
                   
                    <p>Comparing the three promotion methods, a line chart with stack are made to show the effects of the three methods. Two assumptions are made when making this chart.</p>
                    <p>(1) Promotion effect will last for 1 day only<br>
                    (2) The average click rate without promotion are calculated by taking an average between the click rate during 3th to 22th April. As it removes some abnormal peaks due to editing job.</p>
                     
<div id="main4" style="width: 1100px;height:500px;"></div>
<p>The above charts show the contribution of different methods to the total click rate. The upper boundary of the whole chart is the total click rate while the areas show the contribution of each method. Obviously, the "Facebook Promotion" is the most effective one, and it is followed by "Instragram Story Promotion". The "Instagram Post Promotion" is the least effective one.
</p> 

<p> Within the investigation period, a new feature is introduced into the website. A swiper promoting the featured post is added. The swiper promote three of the newly added posts: "Architect", "Art", and "Paper Offering". While the "Market" is not included in the swiper. Since there are four newly added posts, so data collection are only done between 24th to 30th April.</p> 
<div id="main3" style="width: 1100px;height:500px;"></div>
<p> The graph shows the click rate of the four pages. Although "Architecture" has the highest click rate almost among the whole period, it may due to the location in the index page (It is the top post in the blog). When compare the remaining three pages, no significant differences is found. Therefore, the effect of the swiper tool on boosting the click rate of a particular page seems to be little.
 </p>
 
 
 
 
 
<p> After analyzing the promotion effects, we could notice some interesting facts in the result.</p>
<p>Although most of the blog visitors are from Hong Kong, some visitors are from other countries. It slightly shows the power of facebook promotion that it can break the geographical boundaries and link the world together.
</p>
<div id="main5" style="width: 1100px;height:500px;"></div>
<p> Another interesting result is that the Desktop user to Mobile User ratio is almost 1:1. It shows that more and more people tend to use mobile to browse around the Internet. It emphasizes the importance of using cross-device user-interfaces (e.g.: bootstrap).</p>
