    <article><p>The whole blog consists of 10 HTML pages. They are Index page, About me page, Homework 1, Homework 3, Homework 4, Homework 5, Archtecture, Art, Market, and Paper Offering. The Index Page is the main page of the whole blog which link the other page together. The about me page breifly introcduce the hobbies and personalities of the author. The Homework pages are presenting the product in the class JOUR2106. The remaining pages incluing Architecture, Art, Market and Paper Offering are added in the middle of incestigation period to enrich the whole blog with the author's own work from other courses.</p>
    <p>Since the number of pages are too large, we firstly investigate which pages contribute most to the total clickrate and find out the most representative one and analyze it. The contribution of different pages to the total clickrate are shown in the below pie chart. </p>
      <center> <div id="main" style="width: 1100px;height:400px;"></div> </center>
      <p>The above graph show that the "Index page" contribute most to the totalclick rate, which is 51.36% of it. It followed by "About me Page" which contribute 20.46% of the total clickrate. The remaining pages contribute 1-5% each. Therefore, it shows that the Index page and About me page has the highest clockrate among all the pages in the blog. It could be explained that all of the promotion are done on the inex page, therefore, almost all visitor will reach the index page before getting to other pages. This explains the extreme difference between "Index page" and other pages. For" About me Page", it is placed in the top of the index page about the cover photo. It may attract the visitor to click it since it is the first button appear after the entered the website.  </p>
      <p>We then analyze the clickrate variation along the whole month. Since the pages other than "Index page" and "About me Page" contribute little to the total clickrate, only "total Clickrate", "Index Page" and "About me" are shown in the below line chart.  </p>

                <div id="main2" style="width: 1100px;height:500px;"></div>
<p>The above chart briefly shows the clickrate history in April. There are little peak on 8th, 13th and 19th April, which may caused by the testing of website when editing the "Index Page". The chart also show a signifcant surge on 26th and 30th April, which could be the effect of promotion.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>  </p>
                   <p>Promotion were done in 3 stages. The first stage is "Facebook Promotion", the second stage is"Instagram Promotion" and the finally stage is "Instagram Story and Whatsapp Promotion". Three Promotions have different effect on the total clickrate. </p>
                   <p>The "Facebook Promotion" is done on 25th April night. A public post including the link of "Index Page" are posted on the Author's Facebook Wall. The comment and like by her friends also contribute to the effect of the promotion since the friends of the "Liker" will see the post as well. The post got 71 likes and 1 share in total. The post also got 33 comments by both audience and author. </p>
                  
                   <p>The "Instagram Promotion" is done on 27th April night. A private post with photo are posted on the Author's Instagram. This post did not contain a link to the "Index page". The effect of it are expected to be weak when compare to the "Facebook Promotion" since this post are private and the link is not provided in the post. </p>
                   
                   <p>The "Instagram Story and Whatsapp Promotion" is done on 29th April night. A private temporary post links to the profile of author with the link of "Index Page". The Author also use whatsapp message to promote the page to her friends. This is expected to be more effective than "Instagram Page" since the link is provide in this promotion and whatsapp promotion is one-to-one way. </p>
                   
                    <p>Comparing the three method of promotion, a line chart with stack are made to show the effect of three methods. Two assumption are made when making this chart</p>
                    <p>a. the effect of promotion only last for one day<br>
                    b. The average clickrate without promotion are calcuated by taking average between 3th to 22th April, after removing some abnomral peak </p>
                     
<div id="main4" style="width: 1100px;height:500px;"></div>
<p> the above chart show the contribution of different method to total clickrate. The upper boundary of the whole chart is the total clickratem while the area show the contriution of each method. Obviously, the "Facebook Promotion" is the most effective one, followed by "Instragram Story and Whatsapp Promotion". The "Instragram Promotion" is the least effective one. 

<p> Within the investigation periond, a new feature is introduced into the website. A swiper promoting the featured post is added. The swiper promote the three of the newly added post: "Architect", "Art", and "Paper Offering". While the "Market" is not included in the swiper. Since the four newly-added, so data collection are only done between 24th to 30th April. 
<div id="main3" style="width: 1100px;height:500px;"></div>
<p> The graph show the clickrate of four pages. Although "Architecture" have highest clickrate almost among the whole period, it may also due to the upper location in the index page. When compare the remaining three pages, no significant difference is found. Therefore, the effect of the swiper to boost the clickrate of particular page seems very little.
