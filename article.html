    <article>
        <br> There lies a space with 7,000 m² at Nam Shan Road, 30 minutes away from Tai Po Market, where you can have a football match in a vast grassland, jog at the hiking trail and hold a barbecue party with two pits provided.
        </br> 

    <br>It is just one of the rare spacious examples. People can still stretch their legs freely in smaller open spaces within the city centre.    </br> 

    <br>There are 62 public open space in private developments (POSPDs) under lease for the use by the public since 1980, in an attempt to better the urban environment by increasing the public accessibility. Loopholes were seen early in 2008 when the public open space outside Time Square was abused by a property management company and caused public rage. Government then reviewed upon the policy and set up guidelines for the design and management of the public space.  </br> 

<br> Still, the public find it challenging to differentiate one. </br> 

<br>The signs are ambiguous in the public spaces. People can hardly tell if they can use the piece of land since these free spaces are located near private sectors. Outside the building of Communication and Visual Arts Building of Hong Kong Baptist University, there are staircases, an installation art and a nice artificial pond for people and animals to take a rest. Yet, people do not know that they indeed possess the right to enjoy picnic there because of no indications of public space. Not merely in institutes, free spaces in residential and commercial area are not well informed that the public misperceive them as part of the private sectors. Podium Garden, a welcoming place for all, is right next to a public park. The fine line between the two parks actually confuses people if they have to beware of trespassing the “private side” of Royal Peninsula.</br> 

<br>Even with the assistance of signs and the information online, the general public may still be barred from accessing the free areas. The supposed free accessible places are especially hard to be found when they are some storeys above. Unlike the areas on the ground floor, people completely lose track of the trace of public space when they have to climb stairs or take a lift to get there. Example as Royal Ascot 1, public space users have to cross a mini mall and take some lifts so as to be there.</br> 

<br>Physical impediments are not limited to the building itself but also unknowing security guards. From the list provided by Land Department, an 3,518 m² space of should be open in The Belcher's, a residential area near The University of Hong Kong. Based on the description on the free areas from the website, the public space indeed can hardly be found as there is no intersections among Belcher’s Street, South Lane and Pok Fu Lam Road. Nearby, there lied a big playground suspected for public which was surrounded by fences and was not accessible without a resident ID. Asked about the area, a female guard guarding near the gate said that she had no clue about where it was. She did not even have a card accessible to and fro within The Belcher's. Another public platform is on the fifth floor of Hollywood Terrace with a sign welcoming everyone to enter. A woman security guard on the ground floor refused to let non-residents in in spite of showing her the related document. Despite showing the document from, she insisted that there was no space open for public. Same thing happened in Eastern district. "All is private space," said a guard of The Orchards.</br>  

<br>Some public space is occupied by commercial uses. The public space of Lippo Centre which connects the centre and a pedestrian bridge. Yet, some chairs and tables from a coffee shop right next to are sitting in the public spaces. Similar situation is seen on Lee Tung Avenue, which it was taken some spaces by a cafe. However, we cannot verify if the two eateries have violated the clause under lease since we do not have the access to the official lease between the government and the property owners. </br>  

<br>In sight of all the suspected misuse of public space, one may ponder if the government would check regularly. “We’ve received your request and we have delegated to the information unit. But I don’t know who is following up. You better call them,” said an official of Building Department when asked about the responsibility on the surveillance.</br>  

<br>Anthea Cheung, public relations manager from, said the public do not get benefits from it. “The government have never consulted the public on how they want the public space to be. It is all depend on the property owner,’ she said.</br>
